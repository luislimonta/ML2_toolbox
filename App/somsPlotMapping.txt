We can choose, which categorial variable, should be represented in the mapping.
When mapping the winetype (red vs. white), we see, 
that the redwines are clusteres together,
while the whitewines (with a bigger sample size) are spread through the neurons.

As it seems are the SOMs a good instrument in order to differentiate winetypes.
