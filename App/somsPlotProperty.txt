   We can play here a little, on which feature should be represented.
   If we look on quality, we will find high quality at the top right corner.
   Low alcohol is clustered diagonally from the top left corner to the right bottom corner.
   PH-Values are high in the middle.
   The strong outlier, detected in the distances plot, is characterized by really high density. 
   Here might be advisable to double check the datacleaning.
   As mentioned in the codes plot: The observations in the right top left corner seems to have a higher dioxide value.

   When we check the cluster bounderies, we will find, 
   that the properties mentioned above seem to have no real connection to the clustering.
   Fixed acidity seem to have a really clear imput on the clustering:
   Low acidity: dark green cluster, low-middle accidity: Blue cluster,
   Middle-High acidity: light rose cluster, High acidity: magenta cluster.


   Attention: This interpretation is only valid, if the seed are set correctly (here 4). 
   If the seed is set incorrectly, the locations of the properties might change, 
   but the same heatpoint can be detected anyways. 
   And the relation for fixed acidity and cluster bounderies stays the same.
