 After clustering, the structure seems do get even more complex:
 The boundaries are not too smooth and the clusters (espacially the blue one)  have many 'exclaves'.

 Visualizing the mappping, we see, that the cluster boundaries are not anything really near the Red/whitewine boundary.
 When playing around with the porperties, we find, that the properties mentioned above seem to have no real connection to the clustering.
 Fixed acidity seem to have a really clear imput on the clustering:
 Low acidity: dark green cluster, low-middle accidity: Blue cluster,
 Middle-High acidity: light rose cluster, High acidity: magenta cluster.
