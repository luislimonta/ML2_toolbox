If we display the first two dimensions of the PCA, we can see the loadings (variables)  spread in the space of Wine-Type as x-asis and density as y axis.

While checking the contibutions we see, that some of the of the variables like wine type, density and total.sulfur.dioxide
contribute a lot to the space and are well represented (they are close to the circumference of the correlation circle).
Other variables are not well represented and do not contribute as much: PH-Citric-Acid, Quality....

When adding the observations, we can easily detect the split between Red- and white-Wines.
We can also detect two outlies which seem to be very dense and have very low alcohol and diocide rates.
For a better representation, those outliers might taken into consideration to be excluded.

Like the variables, we find that there are observations, wich are betther represented (high cos2 and
other observations near the center with bad representation.)

We can play with the axes we want to be displayed. Normally we would show the first two components, 
since this space explains by far the most variance, but we can also have a look on other components.
   
If we display the fourth and third component as dimensions of the PCA, we can see the loadings and the scores spread in the space of acidity as x-asis and quality as y axis.
We also find, that leaving the first dimension out, no structure between red- and whitewines can be found anymore.
