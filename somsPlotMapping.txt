We can choose, which categorial variable, should be represented in the mapping.\n
    In this case it's the winetype (red vs. white), displayed in the equivalent colors\n
    We see, that the redwines are clusteres in the upper and lower left corner, \n
    while the whitewines (with a bigger sample size) are spread through the neurons.\n
